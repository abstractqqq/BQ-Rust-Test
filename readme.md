# Query from Big Query in Rust

I am a rust noob. This is just me, learning about Rust and and trying to use it (potentially) for ETL purposes. Here I managed to query results from Big Query and get a ResultSet back. Then I am able to parse through the data and get the max close price.

This process is very painful (moving your cursor, iterating, no auto type inference...)

Next step is to look into possibilities to improve it and combine it with other tools to actually move data from BQ to some kind of SQL database.
