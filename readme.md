# Query from Big Query in Rust

I am a rust noob. This is just me, learning about Rust and and trying to use it (potentially) for ETL purposes. Here I managed to query results from Big Query and get a ResultSet back. I have no idea how to turn this ResultSet into anything else (Too lazy of me to dig that deep), but ideally if I want to use this for my ETL, then I should at least be able to send the result data to some SQL database or to csv file.

Anyway, using Rust for I/O tasks is always hard and fun.
